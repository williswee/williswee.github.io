        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2>ðŸ¦— Grasshopper Inc</h2>
        <p>My first shot at entrepreneurship started when I was 10 with a pretty random business: "grasshopper trading." My older brother and I would catch grasshoppers and sell them to classmates to fund our recess snacks. We even had a price list: red-legged ones went for $1, blue-legged for $0.50. Eventually, we expanded into praying mantises, lizards, and spiders. It was scrappy, weird, and a lot of fun. But looking back, that was probably where I caught the builder bug.</p>

        <h2>ðŸŽ´ Trading Cards Inc</h2>
        <p>At 15, I got into buying and selling trading cards. It was easy moneyâ€”most kids didnâ€™t really know the market value of their cards. I just stuck to one simple rule: buy low, sell high. Things were going great until I trusted the wrong shopkeeper who promised to help me sell my cards at my asking price. (He didnâ€™t. And I lost it all, ouch and lol.) Still, it was a great crash course in how middlemen make money and a reminder to always pick who you trust carefully.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ“˜ Friends! Learning Center</h2>
        <p>At 19, my co-founder and I started a small education business: matching students with home tutors. We eventually raised some money to open a tiny space and run group classes and holiday camps. It was a scrappy setup, and we broke even in eight months. While profitable, I realized the business model had a ceiling, as we were tied to our physical location and personal hours. More importantly, I had the difficult realization that while I could run the business day-to-day, I wasn't the right leader to help it evolve. My passion was shifting toward models with greater leverage and scalability. After nearly five years, I made the decision to step down. That chapter was a crucial lesson in product-founder fit and the importance of scale; groundwork that I took directly into building Tech in Asia.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ“° Tech in Asia</h2>
        <p>Before Tech in Asia became Tech in Asia, it was called Penn Olsonâ€”a name I came up with when I was 23. Back then, social media was exploding, and I figured blogging about what was happening in Silicon Valley was the best way to learn.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve always learned best by writing things down. So the name "Penn Olson" came from two words: Pen, because I wanted to write and reflect, and Awesome, because thatâ€™s what learning felt like to me. Penn became this fictional teacher figure who guided me through the early days of tech and social media.</p>
            
        <p>In the early Penn Olson days, we werenâ€™t just blogging. We also ran digital marketing campaigns. One of our wildest projects was for Singapore Airshow 2010â€”where we organized the worldâ€™s first tweetup on a plane (though the plane never took off). The media loved it, but we didnâ€™t love doing agency work. Too many layers, too much fluff.</p>
            
        <p>So we hit a crossroads.</p>
            
        <p>The blog was drifting. We had to decide what we really wanted to be. As I kept reading and writing about Silicon Valley, I found myself drawn to sites like TechCrunch and Mashable. They werenâ€™t just blogs. They were essential infra for the U.S. startup ecosystem. But Asia had nothing like that.
            
        <p>That was the gap.</p>
            
        <p>I tweeted out to ask what our readers wanted to see more of. The answer was clear: coverage on Asiaâ€™s tech scene. So we pivoted. Our first Asia-focused story got great feedback. Readership picked up. Then came our first investor, East Ventures. From there, we started building Tech in Asia.</p>

        <h3>How we were funded</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2011 â€” Seed from East Ventures</li>
            <li>2013 â€” Simile Venture Partners (and East Ventures again)</li>
            <li>Aug 2013 â€” Series A from Fenox VC</li>
            <li>Jan 2015 â€” Accepted into Y Combinatorâ€™s Winter 2015 batch</li>
            <li>June 2015 â€” SoftBank, Walden International, Marvelstone, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew Solimine</li>
            <li>Nov 2017 â€” Investment from Hanwha</li>
            <li>Jan 2024 â€” Acquired by SPH Media</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My most memorable moments</h3>
        <p>One of my all-time highlights was being part of the YC Winter 2015 batch. My group partners were Kevin Hale and Qasar Younis. I also had the chance to get help from Garry Tan and Justin Kan and I'm super thankful for that.</p>

        <p>Sam Altman was YC's CEO back then. On W15 Day 1, he said something along these lines: "There will be at least 3 unicorns from this batch, and 30% of you will exit."</p>

        <p>He wasnâ€™t wrong. My unicorn batchmates included GitLab, Razorpay, EquipmentShare, and GrubMarket (probably more). As of Jan 2025, about 10 years later:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>49 active (39.2%)</li>
            <li>32 inactive (30.6%)</li>
            <li>35 acquired/exited (30.2%)</li>
            <li>116 total (30.2%)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Another milestone was getting acquired by SPH Media in 2024. It gave us a bigger playing field. We applied our startup mindset and processes in a legacy organization, and that was a learning journey on its own. We also went deep into AI which was pretty disruptive for the media industry.</p>
        
        <h3>AI at Tech in Asia</h3>
        <p>One big push I led was News by AI, a workflow that now publishes ~1,300 pieces a month. It took time (and a few pivots), but the results were worth it:
        <ul>
            <li>ðŸš€ +50% in monthly traffic</li>
            <li> ðŸ§  More time for journalists to work on meaningful stories</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>other tools we built (or building):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI Editor: an AI layer on Google Docs
            <li>Fact Checker: flags risky/wrong claims
            <li> Oracle: scalable evals for AI workflows
        </ul>
        <p>We also had to rethink how we build software in the AI era, especially how fast feedback loops work when "domain experts" and engineers all co-create. All these experiences helped grow my knowledge and confidence as we explore the future of work. At TIA, AI is now part of almost everything we doâ€”and weâ€™ll keep using it to supercharge our processes and teamâ€™s capabilities.</p>

        <h3>Not every moment was easy</h3>
        <p>There were also difficult calls to make such as doing layoffs. It's never easy, and never will be. I learned that the best you can do is to be direct and gentle. To respect both those who leave and those who stay. I wrote a bit about that <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/no-perfect-layoff" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
