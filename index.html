            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <p>
                I founded <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/">Tech in Asia</a> with a mission to build and serve Asia's tech and startup community. My role is leading that mission, and I stay deeply hands-on, applying AI to our workflows and connecting with users about our products. I enjoy bridging the gap between beautiful, usable products and a viable business model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the way, we've been lucky to partner with amazing folks like East Ventures, Softbank, and Y Combinator.

                Early on, I taught math, sold vacuum cleaners door‑to‑door, even traded grasshoppers for pocket money. In my early twenties, I launched an education center from scratch. Those early experiences taught me how to grow ideas from 0 to exit.

                When I'm not working, I love spending time with my family 👩🏻👧🏻👧🏻👧🏻, playing tennis 🎾, reading 🧠, daydreaming 💭 and supporting startups that are making a positive impact on our environment 🟢.
