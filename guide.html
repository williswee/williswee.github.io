        <h1>My user guide</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Willis User Guide! I offer this to you because I recognize that the faster we get to know each other and how we work, the better and stronger our relationship will be, and the more we’ll accomplish together. I encourage you to write your own User Guide so your team, and I can learn how to work best with you. This is a living document that will update as I learn more about myself and how we can best support each other.</p>
        
        <h2>Communication preference</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hierarchy of communication (most→ least urgent): Walk-over to my desk→ Slack→ Email. Tag me on Slack to get my full attention.</li>
            <li>I prefer open communication on Slack channels. For example, on product-related topics, use #product-engineering, no private message. Only private message me if it's personal or confidential. I'll do the same.</li>
            <li>I appreciate fast turnaround and acknowledgment of written communications. I like quick “got it” or “on it” type acknowledgments so I know things that we’re discussing are moving.</li>
            <li>If it’s an “FYI” it’s not necessary to respond.</li>
            <li>It is impossible to over-communicate. Do not assume I know what you’re up to. If you’re ever debating including me in communication, do it.</li>
            <li>I prefer you to tell me transparently about your unhappiness and what’s hindering you from doing good work. If I sense something wrong, I’ll ask but I cannot be guessing all the time. Rather than bottling things up, just tell me straight. Practice radical candor.</li>
            <li>I am always interested in the reason why you believe what you believe. All of us have different ways to process information and output a decision or position. Share your logic, data, and thought process, particularly as we build trust. It’s important we learn how we think – our thought process – so don’t worry about over-communicating.</li>
            <li>I’d love for you to ask plenty of questions. I will see that as a red flag if you stop asking questions. I can be most useful if you are proactive with your learning goals. I want to help you learn about our industry and business, particularly early on. You will teach me about your function, and over time, we’ll learn from each other and teach each other based on the inputs we each receive. It’s very fun when we reach the point where that information flows freely back and forth.</li>
            <li>I'm extremely open-minded. Please criticize, point out flaws, suggest, or even call me foolish. I simply want the best solution moving forward, regardless of its source.</li>
            <li>I like to write. Writing brings me clarity, helps me articulate my thought process more effectively, and makes it easy for others to provide feedback and critique. I’ll usually do a follow-up meeting/call to minimize communication gap</li>
            <li>I joke a lot and do it with no bad intentions. I joke because I feel comfortable with you, and it’s my way to connect with you. If I pull an inappropriate joke, let me know. If not, I’ll assume you are fine. I’m open to jokes, too. I'll let you know if I’m not okay with a particular joke.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Management preference</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to work with people who have experience and are smarter than me. They bring on board different perspectives and will move the needle for the company.</li>
            <li>In our initial phase of working together, I tend to be highly collaborative. My goal is to ensure we're fully aligned on goals and context, and to provide all the support you need to get up to speed quickly. As we build that shared understanding and rhythm, my approach naturally evolves to be more of a strategic partner and resource. The end goal is always the same: to set you up to have full ownership of your domain.</li>
            <li>I’m very okay that you fail. I fail all the time. What's unacceptable is not having a mechanism for learning from those failures. I can't collaborate with individuals who fail to learn from their mistakes. The learning loop is critical.</li>
            <li>Our relationship will feel more like a partnership or me supporting you than boss-manager if we’re successful at building trust (though I will be in the manager role whenever needed).</li>
            <li>If I get in your hair again, it could be because:
                <ol>
                    <li>I need to roll up my sleeves to get first-hand info,</li>
                    <li>I don't feel like we are making adequate progress on a given topic/project,</li>
                    <li>Or I’m losing trust in you.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Here are some of the more common reasons that may make me lose trust:
                <ol>
                    <li>You failed to deliver your promise and failed to communicate with me. You assume I’ll forget or understand why certain objectives/KPIs weren’t met without communication.</li>
                    <li>You failed to communicate transparently with me when you had the time and chance.</li>
                    <li>You’re illogical, or your thought process isn’t clear, and you don’t have research/data to back up your case.</li>
                    <li>You repeated the same mistake more than 3 times. We reviewed the problems and came up with a solution. You know the solution but don’t have the discipline to follow through.</li>
                    <li>You prioritized short-term gains over our mission.</li>
                    <li>As a manager, you repeatedly failed to prioritize high-output activities such as building systems, processes, culture, and the team.</li>
                    <li>You showed that you lack values and have shaky moral grounds.</li>
                    <li>You are constantly slow in shipping and getting shit done.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>I’m committed to giving you direct feedback and expect you to do the same.</li>
            <li>I prioritize with a ruthless mindset, valuing clarity and focus as key elements of success.</li>
            <li>When it comes to debugging, my thought process follows these steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>Without judgment/emotions, dive deep into data to gain a thorough understanding of the situation, context, and goal. This likely may include talking to users.</li>
                    <li>Identify bottlenecks that hinder progress or efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Devise solutions for the identified bottlenecks, employing a ruthless prioritization mindset once again.</li>
                    <li>Embrace a bias toward impact, launching initiatives swiftly, and evaluating their success through measurement.</li>
                    <li>Continuously measure the outcomes and make iterative improvements based on the data collected.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>I don’t like conflict but wouldn’t avoid it. I understand that issues arise in every relationship. I see problems as a vehicle for developing greater understanding and stronger bonds. I want to resolve the conflict with you so we both advance.</li>
            <li>I expect fellow managers to focus on building systems, processes, culture, and the team because these are high-output activities. Doing execution work is good if it teaches you to manage long-term better.</li>
            <li>Internalize our company mission and culture code and connect it to your team’s work. Communicate and evangelize them often.</li>
            <li>My biggest value to you is to be a strong vocal advocate for your success and get you the resources you need to be successful. I can remove any blockers, lead and foster collaboration amongst the leadership team to maximize our impact. I’m also committed to surrounding you with a team of peers who inspire you.</li>
            <li>You are likely the top person in the company and/or in your function, and my role as a “coach” can be to:
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>Give you transparency into my role if you aspire to become a CEO/founder</li>
                    <li>Connect you with people at other companies who are leaders in your function</li>
                    <li>Change your role to help you change/increase your scope of responsibility/influence</li>
                    <li>Create an environment where you can perform and feel fulfilled</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>I commit to doing (a) to (d) and expect you to hold me accountable if you don’t feel sufficiently supported.</li>
            <li> Last but not least, I view our team dynamic like a professional sports team (inspired by Netflix). This means we are all deeply committed to high performance, continuous improvement, and holding each other accountable to our shared goals. While a company isn't a family, I believe the best teams are built on a foundation of deep trust, mutual respect, and a strong sense of camaraderie. My role is to put every player in a position to succeed and to ensure we win (and celebrate those wins) together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reporting preference</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a regular, systematic, clearly framed written process by which you share your progress against the plan. Collaborate with me on this.</li>
            <li>Make reporting as quantitative as possible.</li>
            <li>Share updates weekly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My flaws</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I am intensely passionate about our mission. This drive means that in high-pressure situations, my communication can become very direct. I am keenly aware of this and am working to ensure my candor is always paired with patience and empathy. My goal is to challenge ideas, not people. If my delivery ever feels off, I genuinely want you to call it out. It's the fastest way for me to adjust and improve. It’s a continuous learning process to be a better person both at home and at work.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I'm slow to fully grasp a new point or don’t listen well because I’m stuck on an idea or distracted by problems. If I seem distracted, let me know, and try to get my attention.</li>
            <li>I can be over-analytical and slow to act on some opportunities, and impulsive about other opportunities. If that happens, let me know.</li>
            <li>I may not be an expert at your function, and therefore, it may be harder for me to help you with professional development, especially when they are technical-related. I will do my best, and it will benefit you to communicate your professional goals clearly.</li>
            <li>I often get pressured by external stakeholders (customers, board, investors) and may forget to describe the context of any given paranoid moment that I take out on you. Just ask me for the context. I commit this mistake much less now as I prioritize ruthlessly and say “no” to most things.</li>
            <li>My list of flaws is longer, as you’ll learn. Let me know, and I’ll document and improve it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Things you might not know about me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chinese zodiac: Ox / Horoscope: Aquarius</li>
            <li>I came from a poor, broken family. So, I understand the value of money, but I also know that money isn’t everything</li>
            <li>I only got to know my mom at age 5 (I think). I grew up with boys, and now I’m surrounded by girls</li>
            <li>I used to sell grasshoppers, so I have money for recess at school</li>
            <li>I used to set up a tutor-student matching website</li>
            <li>I used to run a tuition center. I was also a math teacher at my center</li>
            <li>I love my kids. I have 3 girls, Diana, Laura, and Kara. Inspired by them, I care a lot more about their future and the world they live in. 2 things I care about a lot more are, ranked by priority:
                <ol>
                    <li>Climate change: I’ve made carbon neutrality one of the top priorities at TIA. I’ve tried my best to reduce (less meat, plastics, and waste), invest in worthy startups and organizations I believe can make a difference, and volunteer whenever possible. I want them to live in a more sustainable and livable world.</li>
                    <li>Women's equality: I want them to live in a world where women and men are equal.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>I sing the most random shits when I feel comfortable, usually at home</li>
            <li>I value happiness over everything</li>
            <li>I enjoy seeing people/things grow</li>
            <li>I have a tough time letting people I care about down. That is why I push myself and others hard</li>
            <li>I’m an introvert. I don’t like big groups. I prefer 1-to-1 chats</li>
            <li>I think I’m funny</li>
        </ul>
